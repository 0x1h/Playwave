Playwave is Open-Source **Music streaming platform** 

Which is mainly written in **[Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)** and in **[React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react)**

and **HUGE HUGE HUGE Thank you for [Deezer API](https://www.deezer.com/us/) for giving me all this musics data, even 30 seconds long audio**

### What can you do on there?
* look for musics 
* create playlists
* modify profile
* edit and delete songs/playlist

wanna hear a joke? this website is serverless and doesn't use any Database xDD
yeah yeah, you guess right website uses **localStorage** so that means every stuff what you do, add, edit or something else everything go in your browser, if you clean up your browser or move on another browser all your stuff will be gone :((

wanna contribute on that project? contribution is closed yet ;/ because i'm not planning to continue this project anymore, but in the future what will happen I don't really know so don't kill your hopes :))

## How to run?

first of all you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) at least version **>=5.2.0**

then run this command in terminal
```js
npm install
```

it will install all dependencies what I used in Project

if project is ready to launch run this command line 

```js
npm start
```

now you are free to go ;)
